# dapp-inbox


A simple app that allows sending "encrypted" messages to the recipient.
Plus key management etc.

Things to do:

[X] - restrict which ERC20 tokens can be sent
[X] - nicer info about pending messages etc.
[X] - better handling of the numbers / digits.
[] - handle network changes correctly.
[X] - once message is complete - remove from position.
[X] - top messages - only show not-processed ones.
